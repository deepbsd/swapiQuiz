# swapiQuiz

A simple quiz app using the Star Wars API; it uses
jQuery/Ajax to fetch all characters in the SWAPI database
inside a Promise (two nested promises, actually), and then
populates a state object, which the quiz uses for the duration
of the user's quiz session. At the conclusion, the user is 
informed of which characters need reviewing and how many 
characters he got right.
